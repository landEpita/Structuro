# Structuro - VS Code Extension

**Structuro** is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to **copy the structure and content of files** directly to the **clipboard**. You can use it via a **right-click** on a file or folder in the file explorer, or with a **keyboard shortcut** to capture all open files in tabs.
